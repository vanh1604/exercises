      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Created by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Tajiri"
          >Santoshi Tajiri</a
        >
        , the idea of
        <i>Pokemon</i>
        came from the concept of bug catching. This makes up one half the the
        goal in almost every iteration of Pokemon. Part 1 is to collect as many
        Pokemon as possible. Players can do that by catching Pokemon in the
        wild, via trading and through evolution of a particular species. Part 2
        is to train the caught Pokemon though Pokemon battles. The higher the
        level of your Pokemon, the better your chances at beating other Pokemon
        trainers, Gym leaders and eventually the Pokemon League
      </p>
      <h3>1 Million ways to have fun with Pokemon!</h3>
      <p>
        Currently there are 722 Pokemon. That is not including those being added
        in Pokemon Sun and Moon, the two upcoming Pokemon titles. With new
        Pokemon constantly being added, there is always something new to look
        forward to. There are many different ways to enjoy the Pokemon
        Franchise.
      </p>
      <h3>Collecting Pokemon</h3>
      <p>
        Collecting Pokemon can be a game within itself. There are 5 ways
        trainers can capture Pokemon and complete their Pokedex.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Capturing wild Pokemon</b> - Either by way of fishing, walking
          around in tall grass or being in the middle of a swarm; there are
          always wild Pokemon up for grabs. Trainers weaken the wild Pokemon by
          lowering its health in battle without beating it to make it easier to
          capture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Breeding Pokemon</b>
          - Trainers can visit the Pokemon daycare to drop off two compatible
          “parent Pokemon ”. These Pokemon will, after some time, create an egg
          that the player can hatch after a certain amount of time and gain a
          new Pokemon. The Pokemon that hatches will be of the same species as
          the mother. Some Pokemon even have a baby form that can only be
          obtained if two Pokemon breed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Evolution</b>
          - Pokemon can grow into different forms and become even stronger. This
          is called Evolution. In most cases they require that the Pokemon
          achieves a certain requirement and these requirements can vary widely.
          One pokemon in particular evolves when you flip your Nintendo DS
          upside down in Pokemon X & Y. Some other requirements are:
